# Policy Guidelines for Adaptive Cognitive Governance

This document expands on the policy implications introduced in the main README.

## 1. Adaptive Regulatory Frameworks
- Iterative review cycles triggered by significant cognitive state transitions.
- Performance-based compliance rather than rigid prescriptive mandates.

## 2. Transparency of Cognitive Transitions
- Auditable logs of cognitive state changes.
- Record integrity check failures and corrective actions.

## 3. Human Override Protocols with Learning Feedback
- Pause execution for integrity verification.
- Trigger a feedback loop for AI systems to learn why intervention occurred.

## 4. Accountability and Liability
- Shared liability frameworks involving developers, operators, and oversight bodies.
- Audit standards for adaptive governance systems.

## 5. Standardized Integrity Check Layers
- Common metrics for confidence levels and uncertainty tracking.
- Standardized APIs for regulatory audits.
