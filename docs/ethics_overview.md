# Ethical Considerations for Adaptive Cognitive Systems

Adaptive AI systems introduce new ethical challenges.

## 1. Maintaining Human Value Alignment
- Continuously monitor for value drift.
- Include human-in-the-loop ethical panels for ongoing recalibration.

## 2. Bias Detection in Adaptive Contexts
- Integrate dynamic bias detection within integrity checks.
- Use adversarial testing for fairness resilience.

## 3. Explainable Adaptation
- Implement explainable adaptation logs.
- Provide visual tools for humans to understand state transitions.

## 4. Human Oversight & Cognitive Load
- Design intuitive visualization dashboards for monitoring.
- Avoid alert fatigue through tiered escalation systems.

## 5. Defining Safe Cognitive Transitions
- Define criteria for safe adaptation.
- Validate new cognitive states before deployment in high-stakes domains.
